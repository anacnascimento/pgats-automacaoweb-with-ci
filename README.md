# ðŸš€ Web Automation with Cypress & GitHub Actions

## Introduction

This project aims to implement a robust Web Automation repository using Cypress for end-to-end testing, seamlessly integrated with Continuous Integration (CI) through GitHub Actions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This initiative serves as a practical project for the **Continuous Integration and Automated Testing** discipline, under the guidance of Professor Samuel. It demonstrates how to set up an automated test pipeline using modern web automation tools.

## âœ¨ Key Technologies Used

- **Cypress.io**: Fast, easy, and reliable testing tool for anything that runs in a browser. Ideal for modern web applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates, customizes, and executes your software development workflows directly in your repository. Used here to run tests automatically on every push.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used to run Cypress and manage project dependencies.
- **npm / Yarn**: Package managers for Node.js, used to install and manage project dependencies.
- **Allure Reporter for Cypress**: Flexible, powerful test reporting tool that generates clear, interactive, and comprehensive reports for test results.
